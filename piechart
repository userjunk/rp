Syntax:
---->pie(x, labels, radius, main, col, clockwise)
-- x is a vector containing the numeric values used in the pie chart.
--labels is used to give description to the slices.
--radius indicates the radius of the circle of the pie chart.(value between -1 and +1).
--main indicates the title of the chart.
--col indicates the color palette.
--clockwise is a logical value indicating if the slices are drawn clockwise or anti clockwise.

Example
# Create data for the graph.
x <- c(21, 62, 10, 53)
labels <- c("London", "New York", "Singapore", "Mumbai")

# Give the chart file a name.
png(file = "city.jpg")

# Plot the chart.
pie(x,labels)

# Save the file.
dev.off()


Example
# Create data for the graph.
x <- c(21, 62, 10, 53)
labels <- c("London", "New York", "Singapore", "Mumbai")

# Give the chart file a name.
png(file = "city_title_colours.jpg")

# Plot the chart with title and rainbow color pallet.
pie(x, labels, main = "City pie chart", col = rainbow(length(x)))

# Save the file.
dev.off()

Slice Percentages and Chart Legend
We can add slice percentage and a chart legend by creating additional chart variables.

# Create data for the graph.
x <-  c(21, 62, 10,53)
labels <-  c("London","New York","Singapore","Mumbai")

piepercent<- round(100*x/sum(x), 1)

# Give the chart file a name.
png(file = "city_percentage_legends.jpg")

# Plot the chart.
pie(x, labels = piepercent, main = "City pie chart",col = rainbow(length(x)))
legend("topright", c("London","New York","Singapore","Mumbai"), cex = 0.8,
       fill = rainbow(length(x)))

# Save the file.
dev.off()

3D Pie Chart
A pie chart with 3 dimensions can be drawn using additional packages. 
The package plotrix has a function called pie3D() that is used for this.

# Get the library.
library(plotrix)

# Create data for the graph.
x <-  c(21, 62, 10,53)
lbl <-  c("London","New York","Singapore","Mumbai")

# Give the chart file a name.
png(file = "3d_pie_chart.jpg")

# Plot the chart.
pie3D(x,labels = lbl,explode = 0.1, main = "Pie Chart of Countries ")

# Save the file.
dev.off()
