Syntax
--->barplot(H,xlab,ylab,main, names.arg,col)
--H is a vector or matrix containing numeric values used in bar chart.
--xlab is the label for x axis.
--ylab is the label for y axis.
--main is the title of the bar chart.
--names.arg is a vector of names appearing under each bar.
--col is used to give colors to the bars in the graph.

Example
# Create the data for the chart
H <- c(7,12,28,3,41)

# Give the chart file a name
png(file = "barchart.png")

# Plot the bar chart 
barplot(H)

# Save the file
dev.off()

Example
# Create the data for the chart
H <- c(7,12,28,3,41)
M <- c("Mar","Apr","May","Jun","Jul")

# Give the chart file a name
png(file = "barchart_months_revenue.png")

# Plot the bar chart 
barplot(H,names.arg=M,xlab="Month",ylab="Revenue",col="blue",
        main="Revenue chart",border="red")

# Save the file
dev.off()

Group Bar Chart and Stacked Bar Chart
We can create bar chart with groups of bars and stacks in each bar 
by using a matrix as input values.

More than two variables are represented as a matrix 
which is used to create the group bar chart and stacked bar chart.

# Create the input vectors.
colors = c("green","orange","brown")
months <- c("Mar","Apr","May","Jun","Jul")
regions <- c("East","West","North")

# Create the matrix of the values.
Values <- matrix(c(2,9,3,11,9,4,8,7,3,12,5,2,8,10,11), nrow = 3, ncol = 5, byrow = TRUE)

# Give the chart file a name
png(file = "barchart_stacked.png")

# Create the bar chart
barplot(Values, main = "total revenue", names.arg = months, xlab = "month"
        , ylab = "revenue", col = colors)

# Add the legend to the chart
legend("topleft", regions, cex = 1.3, fill = colors)

# Save the file
dev.off()
